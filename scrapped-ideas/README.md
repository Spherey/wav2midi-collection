this is another dynamic wav to midi converter, albeit scrapped.

it's been a while, so i don't fully remember how this works, but i recall it employs phase by shifting the window and therefore shifting a given respective/accordant (is that even a word? edit: yeah it is but a better word would be corresponding, i honestly forgot that word existed lol) midi note in time
